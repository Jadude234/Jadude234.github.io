        <div id="mainDiv">Potion Mishaps is a Unity project I made over the course of around two months. In it you use a variety of ingredients and go through a few steps to create a variety
        of potions. First you have to add the ingredients to the cauldron, then heat it up just right, and finish the potion by shaking it up. It was very interesting
        making a game working mostly off of the UI system of Unity.</div>
