        <div id="mainDiv">Prism Platformer is a puzzel platformer I made with plenty of help from Morgan Baker and Kyle Cowsert. I was the project lead in charge
        of the game's direction, and was mainly charge of coding the game to make it work. Specifically I created the various interactables that the player uses
        in order to navigate the puzzels. I also made the main gimmick of the lens allowing you to change the layout of the level. Overall, I believe the project 
        took us three months.</div>
