        <h1 class="title">Smaller Projects</h1>
        <div id="mainDiv">There have been multiple small projects I have made over the course of my learning at NCTC. I have made smaller versions of games like
        puchinko and soccer. I have also made a two player tank game with the goal of defeating the other player. All of those projects I made in Unity,
        but I also made some in Unreal too. I have mad e a game where you run around and collect objects with various effects, 
          and a game in which the player bounces a ball of a paddle to destroy as many bricks at the top of the screen as possible. 
          I made these projects to not only familiarize myself with the inner workings of the engines, but also what they can or can't do.</div>
