        <div id="mainDiv">Color Blaster is a game I made by myself where the goal was to shoot down as many targets as posible within the time frame.
        It was very interesting creating a system to spawn objects in the scene that could interact with various other objects and scripts within Unity. 
        I would say that this game was my first proper challenge in game creation working with a variety of moving parts.</div>
